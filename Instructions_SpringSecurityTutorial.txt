Spring Security basics tutorial
Let's first take a look at my sample program.
It's just a normal web application that I created in my previous tutes.
Now let's apply Spring Security:

Steps:
1. Add Spring Security libraries in pom.xml
 - let maven download the dependency jars
2. Create a separate xml file for security configurations (security-context.xml)
3. Configure web.xml to include Spring Security

Now let's test if Spring Security will be able to secure our resources.
- So Spring Security shows default built-in login page
- let's try to put bad data
- now it's authorized

4. Let's try to configure jsp to put logout
 - Include the SS taglibs
 - let's try

*Now see this issue when we click the browser's back button
- we're back to the secured resource which is not good!
- we will resolve it by adding this configuration. solved!

5. Now let's try to hide some elements in jsp depending on user's role.
- Only admin can manage student records

That's the basics of Spring Security.
You can do a lot of other things to secure your web application.
Stay tuned in my channel for advance topics in Spring Security like
- customizing form login and error pages
- providing users through JDBC, or other sources.
